        <div class="jersey-15-regular"><p >
            We are a group of passionate students from IIEST Shibpur, currently in our first year of B.Tech. We understand that mental health is an important yet often neglected aspect of our daily lives. That's why we decided to create this website‚Äîa platform dedicated to supporting mental well-being, especially for students like us, who often face overwhelming stress and anxiety.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our goal is to offer easy-to-use tools, resources, and activities that can help manage stress, anxiety, and overall mental health. From mood tracking and journaling to relaxation techniques, we hope to make mental health support more accessible, convenient, and encouraging. We believe that by taking small steps every day, we can create a positive difference in our own lives and in the lives of others.
        </p>
        <p>
            Thank you for visiting our website! We hope that the resources and features provided here help you on your journey to better mental health. Stay positive, stay strong, and remember‚Äîyou are not alone. üíñ
